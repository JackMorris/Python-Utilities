/ComputationalSimulations
===============

The directories here contain different simulations of computational models. All are pretty different, so much more implementation information is available in a README in each directory.

What's Included (so far)
========================

* Register Machine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine)

Tests
=====

Unit tests for all of the simulations are included in `tests.py`, inside each directory. These are implemented using the standard Python unittest framework.
