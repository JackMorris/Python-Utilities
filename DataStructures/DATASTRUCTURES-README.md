Data Structures
===============

Each module contains an implementation of a common data structure, usually encapsulated in a class. They are all self documenting.

**Note:** Almost all of the implementations here are more suited to a lower level language, and some replicate functionality that already exists in the Python standard library. They mainly exist for educational purposes, although all can be used in functioning systems if you wish.
