#### **_<p align="center">A collection of various algorithm implementations, helper scrips and other small interesting programs, all implemented in Python 3.</p>_**

Organisation
============

The repository is organised into directories denoting the content, eg. `Sorting/` for sorting algorithms. These directories contain modules for each script/algorithm implementation, as well as two key files:

* `<DIRECOTRY>-README.md` - short readme file containing further information regarding what's in the directory
* `tests.py` - unit tests for the modules in the directory

Contributing
============

Pull requests welcome! Feel free to send any additions and/or modifications/corrections. All code is licensed under MIT, so don't hesitate in using any of the implementaions in your own projects.
