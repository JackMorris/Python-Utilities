Sorting
=======

Each module contains an implementation of a sorting algorithm indicated by the name of the module. This implementation can be used by calling the function with the same name, and the general signature for this function is as follows:

`<algorithm name>(data)`

* `data` is an array of the integers to sort.

Each implementation modifies the original list and sorts it into ascending order, returning None.
