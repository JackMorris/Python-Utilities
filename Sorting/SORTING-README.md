/Sorting
=======

Each module contains an implementation of a sorting algorithm indicated by the name of the module. This implementation can be used by calling the function with the same name, and the general signature for this function is as follows:

`<algorithm name>(data)`

* `data` is the array of integers to sort.

Each implementation returns None, modifying the array passed in.

What's Included (so far)
========================

* Bubble sort
* Counting sort
* Heap sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quicksort
* Radix sort
* Selection sort
    
Tests
=====

Unit tests for all of the algorithms are included in `tests.py`, implemented using the standard Python unittest framework.
